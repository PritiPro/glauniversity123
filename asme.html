<h2>ASME</h2>
<p>
 Founded in 1980 by a small group of industrialists, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers aka ASME is a not-for-profit
 organization. It aims at enabling knowledge sharing, collaboration, skill development, and career enrichment across all the
 engineering disciplines. ASME has a motto to enable the international engineering community to create solutions to make lives
 better. It promotes the art, science & practise of multidisciplinary engineering and allied sciences around the globe.<br><br>

 Fortunately, our college at GLA University has this great ASME community established here on the campus. Founded in 2013, the
 ASME student section in GLA University, Mathura is to provide students from all streams an opportunity to enhance their
 technical knowledge, showcase their talent and network with professionals and other student members from all over the world.<br><br>

 ASME community will enable you to find your talents and abilities and help you improve them with various activities, workshops
 and events under the guidance of the most experienced faculty members and talented seniors of the college. ASME GLAU conducts
