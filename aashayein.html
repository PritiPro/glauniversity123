<p>
 Aashayein is an initiative of ABACUS Technical & Cultural Society under the department of Computer Engineering & 
 Applications. This social club is focusing on eradicating poverty and social injustice. As education is both the means as 
 well as the end to a better life because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it 
 increases one's awareness on a range of issues from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's 
 rights and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.<br><br>

 Under the aegis of this club many activities are organised time to time like Education Camp, Distribution Campaign, 
 children day celebration, Tree Plantation Campaign, Anti-Polythene Campaign, festival celebration at old age home 
 organized in well planned and marginalized communities leading to improvement in their lives and livelihoods.
