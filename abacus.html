<h2>ABACUS COMPUTER SOCIETY</h2>
<p>
 The seed for the ABACUS Society in GLA University was first sown in the year 2009 with the handful of IT enthusiastsâ€™ 
 students and faculty members who felt the need to organize their activities. They also wanted to share their knowledge and
 exchange ideas on what they felt were a fast emerging sector. The purpose of the society is educational directed towards the
 advancement of the theory and practice of the computer science & IT. The idea is spread knowledge and provide opportunities
 to as many interested as possible. The objective of this society is convening conferences, workshops; campaigns and training
 program for the students as well for the general public in order to impart Information Technology awareness. There are a
 number of clubs and Professional chapters running under the departmental society ABACUS.
