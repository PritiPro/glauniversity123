<h1>NATRAJ</h1>
<p>NATRAJ is the official Dance Club of GLA University, Mathura. Dance, the art of precise, expressive, and graceful purposefully 
selected sequences of human movement, is performed according to musical accompaniment. It’s an art, a way to express oneself, a way to exercise, and a way to get feelings out. Dancing developed as a natural expression of united emotion and action.
<br>
<br>
NATRAJ dance club facilitates adequate dance space, which allows students to learn techniques that will help them how to dance and give 
them self-confidence, better balance, and more fluid movements. We organize and perform in all the major events of GLA University. NATRAJ has given such dancers who even won the international competitions for India. NATRAJ is not just a dance club; it is more like a family of students who share the same passion and dream.
<br>
<br>
 By the Grace of Natraj, the club started its journey with a vision and mission to explore the inherent talents of the young generation 
and create a lively ambience on the campus in September, 2015 under the benign guidance of Mr. Neeraj Agrawal, Treasurer, Prof. Anoop Kumar Gupta, and Dr.Vivek Mehrotra
<br>
<br>
 Nataraja, (Sanskrit: “Lord of the Dance”) the Hindu god Shiva in his form as the cosmic dancer, represented in metal or stone in many Shaivite temples, particularly in South India;
 Shiva Nataraja at the Brihadishvara Temple, Thanjavur, India. The club started organizing several programmes and performing on different platforms. As a result, it was recognized and 
appreciated all around.
